HAND TRACKING is characterized by two modules: the palm detection module and the hand landmarks.
Palm detection = works on complete image and provides a cropped image of the hand. From there, the Hand Landmarks module finds
21 different landmarks on this cropped image. To train this landmark they manually annotated 30.000 images of different hands.
